>A simple Gradle project to test with Java, Serenity && Cucumber.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org)
* [Java v11](https://www.java.com)


## Installation

We use [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org), a cross-platform build automation tool that help with our full development flow.
If you prefer [install Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/installation) or use a [Gradle wrapper](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) inside this project.

* Â´git clone https://github.com/alejo-malaver/geonames-timezone-qa-api` this repository

##  Executing the tests

the parameter **-Denvironment** can to take values like:

* dev: development environment.
- stg: staging environment.
+ pro: production environment.

By default, the tests will execute the pro environment, generating report in html and executing only the @Timezone tags test cases:

```bash
./gradlew clean test aggregate
```

For specific tags, use the param -Dcucumber.filter.tags with value of tag or tags to execute

```bash
./gradlew clean test aggregate -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Timezone"
```

The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory, open the index.html file.

The file will detail the results from the latest execution.

To run sonarqube analysis:

```bash
./gradlew sonar -x test
```

A code formatter is included that allows you to sort your code after any change, to use it you can run:
```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

### Environment-specific configurations
We can also configure environment-specific properties and options, so that the tests can be run in different environments. Here, we configure three environments, __dev__, _stg_ and _pro_, with different starting URLs for each:
```json
environments {
default {
base.url = "http://api.geonames.org"
users.file = "users.yml"
}
dev {
base.url = "http://dev.api.geonames.org"
users.file = "usersDev.yml"
}
stg {
base.url = "http://stg.api.geonames.org"
users.file = "usersStg.yml"
}
pro {
base.url = "http://api.geonames.org"
users.file = "users.yml"
}

all {
timezone.path="/timezoneJSON"
}
}
```

You use the `environment` system property to determine which environment to run against. For example to run the tests in the staging environment, you could run:
```json
$ ./gradlew test aggregate -Denvironment=pro
```
In the following link you can view the project running locally, so I suggest executing the project locally to validate the real execution times:
